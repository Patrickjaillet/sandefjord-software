## Project structure

```
src/            Source files (HTML, CSS, JS)
src/partials/   Shared header/footer, injected at build time
docs/           Build output served by GitHub Pages
assets/         Icons and screenshots
data/           Generated software catalog (software.json)
scripts/        Build and GitHub release sync scripts
```

## Pages

- `index.html` — homepage, software listed as cards
- `software.html?id=<software-id>` — software detail template (description, screenshots, changelog, download)
- `downloads.html` — all software and their current versions
- `about.html` — copyright, creator, contact, official repository
- `404.html` — custom not found page

## Stack

Static HTML/CSS/JS, no framework. A Node.js script synchronizes the software
catalog from GitHub Releases (see `scripts/sync-releases.mjs`) and regenerates
`data/software.json`. Running `npm run build` injects the shared header/footer
partials into every page and outputs the final site into `docs/` for GitHub Pages.

Note: the software listed in `data/software.json` is currently placeholder
sample content — real applications will be added in Phase 4 / Phase 3 (auto-sync).

## Design

White theme, one accent color, no decoration beyond what's needed:

- **Color** — background `#FFFFFF`, text `#16232A`, accent (fjord teal) `#0B4F62`
- **Type** — system UI fonts for headings/body; monospace (Cascadia Code / Consolas)
  reserved for factual data: version numbers, dates, requirements
- **Signature** — a quiet fjord contour-line illustration in the homepage hero,
  the only deliberate visual flourish on the site
- No 3D, no animation libraries; transitions respect `prefers-reduced-motion`

Full token list in `src/css/style.css`.
